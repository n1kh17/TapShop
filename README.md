# Project description:
The application will display items and inventories of local stores. The user can view the stores near their vicinity and observe the items available in that store. The users can also order the things they want to be delivered to their homes or office. The items that need to be paid will be done by freelance delivery personnel, like students who pass by the exact location and want to earn some quick money to provide the items. The user can observe the store traffic from the application. The newly available inventory can be added, and not available stock can be updated or deleted. This application helps local stores deliver their items by implementing a freelance delivery feature.
